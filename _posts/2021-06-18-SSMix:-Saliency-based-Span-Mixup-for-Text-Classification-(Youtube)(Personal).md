Paper: [SSMix: Saliency-Based Span Mixup for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08062)
Code: [Official repository for SSMix](https://github.com/clovaai/ssmix)


As I promised on the previous post, I made an additional material that fully explains about the SSMix paper,

Also, as I was preparing for the 3-minute video that I need to submit for ACL 2021,
I found out that 3 minute is just too short to fully explain about my work.

Therefore, I decided to additionally make a video at youtube that throughly explains starting from what mixup is, along with the additional / full explanation of results.

However there is several things I want to emphasize.

- The video is made one-take, so the quality is not guaranteed (Sorry..)

- This is an **unofficial**(personal) version of explaining my work. If you are looking for the official thing, please refer to the to-be-updated video at ACL 2021!
